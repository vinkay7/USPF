# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Design a Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing inventory at a Nigerian government agency (USPF). The app should include a login page with hardcoded username and password ('admin'), logo placeholder, role-based access (admin, store officer, departments), inventory management, digital BIN card history, requisition requests, barcode/QR code generation and scanning, reports, and offline mode using PWA tech. Use soft government-appropriate color palette and modern hybrid dashboard-landing design. Backend: Supabase instead of current MongoDB setup."

    message: "Completed testing of the backend API endpoints after logo updates. Fixed a dependency issue with the Supabase client by installing the missing 'gotrue' module. After resolving this issue, all backend tests are passing successfully. The authentication system with uspf/uspf credentials is working correctly, with the POST /api/auth/login endpoint returning the 'uspf-token' and the GET /api/auth/me endpoint correctly returning user information. The inventory management endpoints (GET /api/inventory, POST /api/inventory, PUT /api/inventory/{item_id}, GET /api/inventory/{item_id}/bin-card) are all functioning properly. The dashboard statistics endpoint (GET /api/dashboard/stats) returns the expected data. The requisition system endpoints (GET /api/requisitions, POST /api/requisitions) are also working correctly. All endpoints return appropriate status codes (200 for successful requests) and proper JSON responses. The health check endpoint is not accessible in the current deployment configuration, but this doesn't affect the core functionality. The backend is fully operational after the logo updates."
